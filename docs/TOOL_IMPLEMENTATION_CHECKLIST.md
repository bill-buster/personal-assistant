# Tool Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to implement tools one by one. Copy the tool name and description to use with `/impl_add_tool`.

## Quick Start

1. Pick a tool from the list below
2. Run: `/impl_add_tool [tool_name] - [description]`
3. Check off the tool when done
4. Move to next tool

- [ ] `system_info` - Get OS, memory, CPU information.
- [ ] `environment_vars` - List or get environment variables.
- [ ] `process_list` - List running processes (filtered, safe subset).

## Phase 8: Package Management (Priority: Low)

- [ ] `npm_list` - List installed npm packages in current directory.
- [ ] `npm_search` - Search npm packages (read-only, no install).
- [ ] `check_updates` - Check for outdated packages in package.json.
- [ ] `audit_security` - Run npm audit for security vulnerabilities.

## Phase 9: Productivity Tools (Priority: Low)

- [ ] `time_track` - Track time spent on tasks or projects.
- [ ] `pomodoro` - Start a pomodoro timer (25-minute work session).
- [ ] `journal_entry` - Create daily journal entries.
- [ ] `habit_tracker` - Track habits with daily check-ins.

## Phase 10: Network Utilities (Priority: Low)

- [ ] `ping` - Ping a host to check connectivity.
- [ ] `check_port` - Check if a network port is open.
- [ ] `download_file` - Download files from URLs to local path.
- [ ] `curl` - Make HTTP requests (safe subset, read-only by default).

## Phase 11: Clipboard Operations (Priority: Low)

- [ ] `clipboard_read` - Read current clipboard content (macOS/Linux).
- [ ] `clipboard_write` - Write text to clipboard (macOS/Linux).

## Phase 12: Backup and Archive (Priority: Low)

- [ ] `backup_files` - Create backup of files or directories.
- [ ] `archive_create` - Create zip/tar archives from files.
- [ ] `archive_extract` - Extract zip/tar archives.
- [ ] `sync_directory` - Sync directories (compare and copy differences).

## Phase 13: AI-Powered Code Assistance (Priority: High, Requires LLM)

- [ ] `explain_code` - Explain what code does in plain language (uses LLM).

## Progress Tracking

**Total Tools:** ~100+
**Completed:** 2 (`delete_file`, `move_file`)
**Remaining:** ~98+

**Current Phase:** Phase 1 (Core File Operations)
**Next Recommended:** `move_file` or `copy_file`

## Notes

- Tools are organized by priority and complexity
- Start with Phase 1 for highest value, easiest implementation
- Phase 13 (AI-Powered) requires LLM provider to be configured
- All destructive operations should require confirmation
- See `docs/PROPOSED_TOOLS.md` for detailed descriptions
- See `docs/ADDING_TOOLS_GUIDE.md` for implementation patterns
