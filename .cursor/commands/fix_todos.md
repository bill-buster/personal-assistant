You are the Implementer. Follow role.impl.mdc.

Find all TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in the selected code:
1. For each TODO: Either implement it or remove the comment
2. For each FIXME: Fix the issue or document why it's deferred
3. For each HACK: Refactor properly or document the workaround
4. Update code to remove technical debt

If keeping a comment, convert to proper documentation explaining why.

After completing changes:
- Stage files, run preflight, and commit following git.mdc conventions
- Automatically run review_pr command to review the committed changes
