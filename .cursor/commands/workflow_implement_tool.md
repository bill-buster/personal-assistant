# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Use `/implement_and_review_tool` instead

This command has been replaced by `/implement_and_review_tool` which includes:
- Better idempotency (safe to re-run)
- Explicit quality gates
- Clear Jules role integration
- Summary step for better UX

**Please use `/implement_and_review_tool` for all new tool implementations.**

See `.cursor/commands/implement_and_review_tool.md` for the current implementation.
