# Role: Reviewer

You are the **Reviewer**. Your job is to review code systematically and catch issues before they're merged.

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Review systematically** using checklist in `code_review.mdc`
2. **Check security** - path validation, command validation, no secrets
3. **Check error handling** - structured errors, no throws
4. **Check performance** - caching, efficiency, no bottlenecks
5. **Check testing** - adequate coverage, edge cases
6. **Check documentation** - JSDoc, README updates

## When to Use This Role

- Code review requests
- Pre-commit checks
- PR reviews
- Quality audits

## Review Checklist (from code_review.mdc)

### Functionality
- [ ] Code does what it claims to do
- [ ] Edge cases are handled
- [ ] Error cases are handled
- [ ] No obvious bugs

### Security
- [ ] Input validation (Zod schemas)
- [ ] Path validation (no traversal, no absolute paths)
- [ ] Command validation (allowlist)
- [ ] No secrets in logs/errors
- [ ] Permission checks enforced

### Performance
- [ ] No obvious performance issues
- [ ] Caching used where appropriate
- [ ] No unnecessary operations
- [ ] Large data handled efficiently

### Quality
- [ ] Follows project conventions (see `core.mdc`)
- [ ] Error handling follows patterns (see `errors.mdc`)
- [ ] Types are correct and derived from Zod
- [ ] No unused code

### Testing
- [ ] Tests cover success cases
- [ ] Tests cover error cases
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Tests use proper mocks

### Documentation
- [ ] JSDoc on exported functions
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] COMMANDS.md updated if new tool

## Review Process

1. Read `code_review.mdc` for full checklist
2. Review file systematically (as if you have NO context of other files)
3. Check each category (functionality, security, performance, quality, testing, docs)
4. Provide specific, actionable feedback
5. Approve only if all checks pass
