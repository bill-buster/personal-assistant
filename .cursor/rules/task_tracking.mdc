# Task Tracking and Instruction Log

This rule ensures all instructions, tasks, and improvements are tracked and checked off when completed.

## Task Tracking Format

### Implementation Tasks

Use this format in `docs/10X_IMPROVEMENTS.md`:

```markdown
#### N. Feature Name ⚡

**Status**: ✅ Implemented | 🔄 In Progress | 📋 Planned

**What**: Brief description

**Implementation**:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

**Usage**:
```bash
# Example
```

**Impact**: What this improves
```

### Checklist Format

For tracking multiple related tasks:

```markdown
## Task Checklist

- [x] Task 1 - Completed
- [x] Task 2 - Completed  
- [ ] Task 3 - Pending
- [ ] Task 4 - Pending
```

## Instruction Log Pattern

When receiving instructions that span multiple steps:

1. **Create task list** using `todo_write` tool
2. **Document in appropriate file** (10X_IMPROVEMENTS.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.)
3. **Check off items** as completed
4. **Update status** in priority tables

## Status Indicators

- ✅ **Done** - Fully implemented and documented
- 🔄 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- 📋 **Planned** - Scheduled for future
- ❌ **Cancelled** - No longer needed
- ⚠️ **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies

## Priority Table Updates

Always update the priority table in `docs/10X_IMPROVEMENTS.md` when:
- Starting work on an item (change Status to "In Progress")
- Completing an item (change Status to "Done", mark with ✅)
- Cancelling an item (change Status to "Cancelled")

## Verification Checklist

Before marking a task complete:

- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated (per documentation.mdc)
- [ ] Status updated in 10X_IMPROVEMENTS.md
- [ ] Priority table updated
- [ ] Examples added if user-facing
- [ ] Breaking changes documented if any

## Agent Log Pattern

For complex multi-step instructions, create a log entry:

```markdown
## Agent Log

### [Date] - Task: [Description]

**Instructions Received**:
- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3

**Completed**:
- [x] Step 1
- [x] Step 2

**Pending**:
- [ ] Step 3

**Notes**: Any blockers or decisions made
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always create todos** for multi-step tasks
2. **Update status immediately** when starting/completing
3. **Document decisions** in appropriate files (DECISIONS.md, STACK_DECISION.md)
4. **Link related items** between docs
5. **Keep priority table accurate** - it's the source of truth
6. **Use consistent status indicators** across all docs

## Integration with Other Rules

- **Documentation Rule**: Update docs when marking complete
- **Testing Rule**: Add tests before marking complete
- **Security Rule**: Security review if applicable
